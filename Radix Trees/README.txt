RadixTree.class - the RadixTree class contains all the methods and variables needed to construct a working radix tree. It has insert, delete, contains, and toString methods. Additionally, there is an autocomplete method that you can try for fun. 

Node.class - the Node class is an embedded class that is used by RadixTree. It creates a simple node with a daat variable, and a list of 26 nodes for its children. 

NiceTester.class - simple tester for you to run to make sure its working properly.

AutoComplete.class - this program inserts a bunch of words into a radix tree and uses the autocomplete method to print out the remaining possible words from a prefix. Just shows how useful this data struture can be. If you want to download the dictionary text file to use this, I'll include it in the folder, though it is about 5 MB.
